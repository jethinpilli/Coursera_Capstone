I'm going to use data set provided in Week 1 about collisions in Seattle (Data-Collisions.csv) and after
checking the data there is a need to clean them and select main features used in
the further analysis. Cleaning of data mainly consists of:
- unification of values in columns (some used Y,N,1,0) - UNDERINFL
- binary codification of Y/N values into 1/0
- convert values in column to same data type (int)
- convert INCDATE from str into Date type
- drop NaN and empty rows in the selected features which we are going to use

I will drop the following columns from the dataset:
- OBJECTID
- REPORNO
- STATUS
- INTKEY
- LOCATION
- EXCEPTRSNCODE
- EXCEPTRSNDESC
- PEDCYLCOUNT
- PEDCOUNT
- INCDTTM
- SDOT_COLDESC
- INATTENTIONIND
- UNDERINFL
- PEDROWNOTGRNT
- SDOTCOLNUM
- SPEEDING
- ST_COLDESC
- SEGLANEKEY
- CROSSWALKKEY

I will use the following columns:
- HITPARKEDCAR
- LIGHTCOND
- ROADCOND
- WEATHER
- SDOT_COLCODE
- JUNCTIONTYPE
- INCDATE
- VEHCOUNT
- PERSONCOUNT
- COLLISIONTYPE
- SEVERITYCODE
- ADDRTYPE
- X
- Y
- INCKEY
- COLDETKEY

In these some are numerical columns and some are categorical columns.
